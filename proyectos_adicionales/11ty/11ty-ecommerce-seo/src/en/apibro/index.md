<h1>API</h1>

API plays a central role in application development lifecycle. It impacts delivery cycle and software quality. Proper API management can increase the agility of engineering team, and in larger scope, the business.

The API directory maintains a catalog of APIs of services. The APIs are defined using  OpenAPI v3 specification.

You can leverage the API definitions with various [tools](https://openapi.tools/) in the ecosystem to generate stubs, mock servers, validators, and more.
