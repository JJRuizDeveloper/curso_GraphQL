### Themes

A theme is a collection of templates (under the `_includes` folder) that generates a specific type of content.  An example is the **Technology Radar**, which renders a page for the radar and a page for each of the blips.

-  [Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). For more detail see [./src/_includes/radar/](./src/_includes/radar/). See live sample: [/en/radar/]({{ '/en/radar/' | url }})
